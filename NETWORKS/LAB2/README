DESCRIPTION:
SFTS (Simple File Transfer Services)
In this programming assignment, you are to build a simple file copy service that
consists of a client and server. The server and client program should run on
separate machines.



************Structure***********
This program is self-contained in the respective server and client files. There
are no header files or external things compiling. It is pure spaghetti code.

Running the server will provide some IP for the client to connect to by opening
proper channels at the port specify and will also handle forking the process for
each client and also handling the removal of zombies.

Running the client will drop you on a commandline with the option to type 'help'
for a list of commands.

The commands are as follows:

ls [options]  - Display all the file names under current directory
pwd           - Display current directory information
catalog       - Display the all file names under current server directory
spwd          - Display current server directory information
download source-filename dest-filename
              - Download file from server
upload source-filename dest-filename
              - Upload file from server

Each command is fully implemented.

Program transfers files and shows directory details until user on client types
'bye' at which point the client is disconnecting and the thread it was on is
cleaned up.



**************Status************

-> Tested on MacBook Pro running High Sierra OS(10.13.4); 3.1GHz Intel Core i7;
   16 GB 1867 MHz DDR3

	-using gcc/g++ 7.2.0 processor
	-Linted using both Clang and gcc 7.4.2

-> Debugged using lldb

-> Tested on csegrid.ucdenver.pvt


*************************************************
** WORKS PARTIALLY: NO ERROR CHECKING ON UPLOAD**
*************************************************


XXX: Future implementations will perhaps give the option to navigate through the
servers directories.
