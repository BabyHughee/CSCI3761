Assignment

**************************************************************
************ TO COMPILE ----- 'make all'	               *****
************ TO RUN --------- './MST' [filename] #binary *****
**************************************************************

DESCRIPTION:
We have discussed the usage of minimum spanning tree when you try to extend LAN
segments with link-layer switches (bridges). In this programming assignment, you
will be implementing Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) Algorithm with either C or C++.

************Structure***********
This program takes a command line argument of the input file.
At a base level there exists a in line interface "exceptionStatus.h" used to
inform the user and the program of what went wrong where. The file
"kaestLab3_main.cpp" is the main driver function. It makes all function calls
and outputs the visuals. "kaestLab3.h" contains the necessary structs to execute
and all the function prototypes. "kaestLab3.cpp" contains all the implementations
of the prototype functions and the functions that are depended on which are not
contained in the interface file.


**************Status************

-> Tested on MacBook Pro running High Sierra OS(10.13.4); 3.1GHz Intel Core i7;
   16 GB 1867 MHz DDR3

	-using gcc/g++ 7.2.0 processor
	-Linted using both Clang and gcc 7.4.2

-> Tested on csegrid.ucdenver.pvt
